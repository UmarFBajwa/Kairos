#### <a name="why"></a>Why?
Why create Kairos?

Ride in an Uber and you'll see what payment should be, invisible. Money changes hands, yet you never even think about the payment. Every transaction should be like this. For example parking validation. Have you ever forgotten to validate your parking ticket? Or worse yet, lost it and had to pay absurd fees? That stops today. Using Ingenico, Kairos solves this headache.

#### <a name="instructions"></a> Instructions

A User makes a payment at the Venue (restaurant, movies, concert, etc). Using existing technology, they can use the same payment method and simply tap and go to exit the Parking Garage. No more tickets or having to go to some machine.
